This is my second attempt at learning web development. I am determined to see it through this time and get a job in web dev by the end of Q1 2020. 

I am currently working on the first mini project in the Web Development 101 section, called Project: HTML/CSS. For this project, we will be building a mirror of the Google homepage but without the functionality.

This exercise will help us better understand the use of divs, classes, IDs, CSS positioning, forms, form fields and more. On the back end, we will likely use git to upload our results onto GIthub for others going through The Odin Project to check out.
